This is a Python implementation of using quasars as standard candles described in "Quasars as standard candles III. Validation of a new sample for cosmological studies", A&A 2020. The catalog used in this script is available at http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/642/A150.

Below code is a step-by-step instruction of how researchers establish the hubble diagram for quasars at high redshift:
1. Perform a linear fit on the UV and x-ray flux data to find the log-linear relationship.
This is based on a log-linear relation found between Luminosities of X-rays and Ultraviolet. Replacing Luminosity in the equation with expression of Flux, we get the log-linear relation of Flux that we can perform a linear fit to get the parameters beta and gamma.
